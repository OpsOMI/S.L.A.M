# Client ID and User Binding Security

## Overview

To ensure that each physical client device (e.g., a flash drive) is uniquely associated with a single user, the system implements a **Client ID - User binding mechanism**. This approach enhances security by preventing unauthorized usage of copied or duplicated client devices.

## What is Client ID?

- **Client ID** is a unique identifier embedded in each client device.
- It acts as a hardware-bound identity that is read and sent to the server whenever the client connects.
- The Client ID is stored securely on the client device and is immutable during normal operation.

## User and Client ID Binding

- Each **User** in the system is explicitly linked to a **single Client ID**.
- This means a User account can only log in from the client device with the matching Client ID.
- When a user attempts to connect, the server verifies if the provided Client ID matches the one registered to that User.

## Security Benefits

- **Prevents unauthorized access:** If a client device is copied or stolen, it cannot be used by a different User because the Client ID will not match.
- **Device usage tracking:** The system can track which physical device is used by which User.
- **Ban mechanism:** If suspicious activity is detected (e.g., a Client ID is used with multiple User accounts), the server can block that Client ID, preventing misuse.

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

- **Client device cloning:** If an attacker copies the Client ID from one device to another, they might attempt unauthorized access.

  - **Mitigation:** Implement additional hardware-backed security or encryption tied to the device.

- **Device loss or replacement:** If a User loses their client device, a secure process for registering a new Client ID should be established, ideally requiring administrative approval.

## Summary

This binding mechanism ensures a robust layer of security by tightly coupling the client device identity with the user account, minimizing unauthorized use of the client software from copied or stolen devices.
